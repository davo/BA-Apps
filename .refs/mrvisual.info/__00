                    </header>
                    <p><strong>Blog Forum Gdańsk</strong> is an interdisciplinary conference, which takes place in Gdańsk every year since
2010. In 2012 the main topic of the conference were practical skills which come along with from blogging.</p>
                    <h3>I mapped polish blogosphere</h3>
                    <p>Organizing Committee of Blog Forum Gdańsk had definitely challenged me. My task was to create an infographic which shows most popular polish bloggers. They were selected on the basis of the analysis prepared using the tools by Brand 24 and Sotrender. I dedicated long hours of my conceptual and design projecting work to this task. I decided to portray bloggers as individuals who lived on thematically selected islands. The final map consist of 6 big and 10 little islands floating on Yotube Mare. They are as follow: The Lifestyle Island inhabited by 14 bloggers, Hobby Island, of 4 people, 3 people living on Facebook Island, 13 on Technology Island, 2 in Corporate Land and 4 in Political Jungle.</p>
                    <h3>Designing in a good taste</h3>
                    <p>Every blogger has his own icon with his image, which is located on his part of the island as a geotag. I have done my best to capture characteristically features of each of them. In addition I designed pictograms for each area of the island. The Peninsula of Apple is symbolized with characteristic half - bite apple with monocle, The Gorge of Culinary is depicted with Mr. Pot, who evade his lid like a hat. I created 19 graphics of this type. Adding the50 portrays of bloggers, give us 69 unique icons altogether.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>For the request of <strong>City Council in Sopot</strong> I created an unique budget bulletin based on infographics. It is citizens-friendly thanks to the Sopoccy family, who guide the reader through. It’s a multigenerational family, and they describe city budget through their interests and their actual life stage and position. Each of them has one card, where city expenses which he or she benefits from are described.</p>

                    <p>BBudget is a complicated document and it took me many hours to untangle the financial puzzles. I’m proud of final effect, which is 8 slides dedicated to city expenses illustrated by means of icons and graphics. Even seemingly boring subject as budget can be attractively presented. Of course thanks to visualization! </p>
                    <h3>Usage</h3>
                    <p>Such brochure can be used in many ways. I recommend it especially for online usage, because it has great viral potential in social media. It also can be send by e – mail or be downloaded for a website. If printed, it can take interesting form of postcards, posters, folder or installation and other</p>

I think it worked, because many people were interested in entering the conest! ;) </p>

To show how the company had recently changed, I design the animation, which shows it in an interactive way in only several dozen seconds.The animation accompanied the launch of the brand. It was the main channel of communicating the modifications in the brand image. Its premiere took place during a confreance organised for their ten years annivesary. The animation enhances the way of informing customers and stakeholders about Insoft’s Consulting rebranding. It shortly tells the story about ideas and values that stand by this brand and shows lifting of the old logo. It also presents a new visual identity. I strongly recommend this way of changes and improvement presenation and for every company that wants to stands. Customer attention guranteed! ;) </p>

                    </header>
                    <p>I was asked by <strong>Gdańsk City Hall</strong> to prepare materials, which in an easy and interesting way tell the story of positive changes and improvements that have been introduced in the city during past two years. I carefully analyzed possible ways of presenting that material and I have chosen infographics as the most suitable and viewer-friendly form…<a href="http://www.adamowicz.pl/infografiki" target="_blank">See how they look like!</a>.</p>
                    <h3>Big changes in an attractive form</h3>
                    <p>At first, I felt overwhelmed with the amount of information as I received 32-pages long report. My priority was to find lucid and attractive way to communicate with citizens of Gdańsk. I converted a large number of text, tables and data into a modern form of infographics.</p>
                    <h3>The creation is not always easy</h3>
                    <p>I decided to divide the materials into four thematic parts and assigned particular city changes and achievements to each of them. Projects and ideas were briefly consulted with President’s Office during the whole process. As a result of our mutual cooperation we distinguished four areas of city development: commuting, recreation and sport, development and life & city.</p>
                    <h3>The effect – readable and friendly massage</h3>
                    <p>As the result I made four infographics, which in clear and interesting way show how the city council actions brought changes to Gdańsk. Each infographic illustrates particular goals depicted by attractive and colorful graphics and icons. Moreover, they are supported with dedicated slogans for each thematic part.</p>

This is an aspiration to community and synergy among every self governments associated in GMA, and keeping their individual spirit at the same time.</p>

Its aim is to integrate local, creative entrepreneurships and to create a space fordevelopment and experience exchange. Based on the summaries I received on many meetings, I made an infographic which sums up the project.</p>
                    <h3>Numbers don’t have to be boring</h3>
                    <p>Reports I got from organizers had many numbers and statics. I have decided to deal with the project with my intrinsic sense of humor and illustrated for exmaple - how many sandwiches were eaten by participants, how many chairs were used, how much coffee they drank. I presented statistics using icons to visualize character of the meetings. I displayed range of the project on a simplified map of Europe, which helps imagine the distance between the cities. Local character of the project is highlighted by the background of infographic which displays contours of characteristic Old Town buildings in Gdańsk.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p><strong>Start People - Work and Personal Consultancy Agency,</strong> asked me to design infographic, which illustrates students’ demands for labour market. An infographic visualize extensive data gathered by Start People as a result of the survey conducted among students of public universities in Gdańsk and Łódź.</p>
                    <h3>They are separated by 334 km, but do they have separate labour market demands?</h3>
                    <p>I received two reports full of figures, which together had 40 slides with tables and statistics. Fortunately, analysis and synthesis are my strong sides. Thanks to them and with help of icons and pictograms I succeeded in designing readable and simply message as infographic. I took into account the most important facts, which I divided in nine thematic categories. I illustrated differences with an image of female student, who is “with one feet in Gdańsk, and one in Łódź”. I wanted to highlight two different point of views with looks and outfit. These students are not only 334 km distant from each other, but also vary in life choices. For example, students from Gdańsk more often choose technical faculties, whereas students from Łódź choose social – economical faculties.</p>
                    <h3>Readable and colorful</h3>
                    <p>A range of icons and graphics make illustrations more diverse, thus helping the viewer to understand the message and information. At first glance one can see what they have in common and what is different for the students from these two cities. The whole design is maintained in pastel colors to please both young and elder recipients. It was used to promote Conference Start HR: “Students’ run for career – a sprint or a marathon?” organized by Start People in Gdańsk and Łódź in April 2012.</p>

                    <p>Universities which enter the competition for students should invest in good trainer, because dark clouds are gathering above them. To make long story short, according to forecasts demographic decrease will take down private higher education and devalue public universities by 2020.</p>
                    <h3>Data, statistics, reports</h3>
                    <p>Largest Polish daily journal, “Gazeta Wyborcza” published an article which inspired me to verify the forecasts about the condition of Polish higher education system. I prepared an infographic based on statistical yearbooks from GUS (Central Statistical Office), data from Ministry of Science and Higher Education, reports from Economic Research Institute, Ernst &Young Business Advisory and media materials. It shows universities, their values and brands form marketing perspective. In result, analysis of abovementioned sources makes a picture of present and future conditions on academic market.</p>
                    <h3>University is also a brand</h3>
                    <p>The aim of designing this infographic was to show the influence of demographic decline on public and private higher education institutions and encourage people to take up public debate. Competition for students, best lectures, investors and donors should become a base for building strong and recognizable brands. As a result of planned and well-considered actions Polish universities
can also create trustworthy brands. An example of good university branding are universities in Western Europe which invest in themselves as well as their students.</p>
