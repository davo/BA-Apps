		        		<p><strong>Specless is grounded in perspective.</strong> We experienced the explosive growth – and challenges – of mobile advertising while working at one of the largest global creative agencies and later when managing mobile monetization at a ComScore Top 10 property.</p>
		        		<p>Seeing all this first-hand, we knew there had to be a better way to create and deliver ads for this dynamic, mobile world. We wanted ads that ran fluidly and seamlessly between all devices, mirroring the way people move between these devices effortlessly.</p>
		        		<p>We know from experience that effective campaigns perfectly meld a smart placement, solid strategy, great ideas, eye-catching visuals and unforgettable copy. But the weak link, as we saw it, was translating this combination into the responsive, digital realm. Sites were adopting responsive frameworks and starting to "flow" across many devices, but that ads remained rigid and inflexible.</p>
		        		<p>So we set out to solve this issue by building a platform that was incredibly simple to use, yet allowed all of these elements to flow seamlessly across ad slots of various sizes and formats. We wanted to remove the ads specs and constraints from the equation entirely. Which is how the Specless ad format came to be and is our reason for being.</p>
